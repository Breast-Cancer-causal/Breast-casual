# Breast_casual


**1. Project Discription*

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women.
Breast Cancer occurs as a results of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. 
A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous).
 Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.

The objective of this project is to apply learnt machine learning techniques to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data. The WDBC data is class labeled, hence it will be a classification problem. The data has two classes (B=Benign, M=Malignant) and 32 attributes, or features.

Using the following machine learning techniques, we will aim to build classifiers to predict the classes of the data. 

#1) Linear regression,

#2) Random Forest, 

 #3) Neural network and 

#4) K-means algorithm.

## 2) Introduction

`Breast_casual` is a python package for describing and manipulating [Causal Graphical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_graph) and [Structural Causal Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling). Based on the graph it will help user to make casual inference , manuplate different machine learning models and do comparisn of models.

It is currently in a very early stage of development. All feedback is welcome.


## Example

For a quick overview of `Breast-casual`, see notebook("  ....").

## Install
